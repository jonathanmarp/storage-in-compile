This is the repository where you can place the compiled cmake. Which comes from the Linux architecture x32.
If you want to contribute. you can just put it here. with other operating systems too. and different architectures.

:pushpin: But if I'm going to issue i386 linux system and x32 architecture

:triangular_ruler: If I want to contribute the push file after that I will put it on release. and if you want to put a :file_folder: folder or make it with the right name like linuxi386, then make another version of the cmake. and there the file runs out, the cmake file will be deleted so that people who want to contribute don't mind cloning this repository.
